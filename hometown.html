        <h2>A Brief Introduction of Hefei</h2>
        <p>Hefei, pronounced as [huh fe], is the capital city of Anhui Province,
          China, where I had lived for almost 20 years of my life. Here I will
          introduce

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The scripted history of Hefei can be dated back to more than 3000
          thousands years ago when the city of Hefei. In 221 B.C., when the First
          Emperor of China (Qin Shi-Huang) unified the whole China, Hefei started
          to be built as a regional cultural and economic center. Experiencing
          vicissitudes of all the ancient dynasties, Hefei now has become a capital
          city and the head of Second-Tier Cities in China.

        <h2>Development and Culture</h2>
        <p>As the economic and cultural center of Anhui Province, Hefei occupied
          11445 kilometer squared spaces which has similar land size of 15 Singapores or
          52 Seattles combined! This sounds crazy for just a normal capital city in China.
          With such large lands, our city holds around one hundred million population.
          As the center city of Hefei Metropolitan Circle, our development has been pacing
          forward rapidly with an annual GDP increase rate at 3.5%. In technology field,
          Hefei is a world-pioneering city for scientific researches, led by University of Science
          and Technology of China, especially in engineering field.
        </p>
        <p>Since Hefei is a cultural center of the region, local people usually hold
          many cultural events throughout a year. We hold Lu-Opera Festivals,
          Three-Kingdoms-Culture Festivals, and even Crayfish Festivals!

        <h2>Scenic spots</h2>
        <p>Hefei is a really good sightseeing city with many scenic spots combining history
          and natural scenarios, but my personal favorite is definitely "Sanhe Town."
        </p>
        <p>Being evaluated as a "National AAAAA level tourist attraction," same as the
          Palace Museum, Sanhe Town absolutely deserves its reputation. As the origin of Lu Opera,
          Sanhe Town has well preserved its 2500+ year history in its rivers, bridges, streets and
          other buildings.

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>sanhe rice dumplings</li>
          <li>braised spicy crayfish</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If Sanhe Town hasn't interested you, how about the Sanhe Rice Dumplings? I remember
          every time I went to Sanhe Town, I could see a huge volume of people standing in the line
          waiting for rice dumplings. The dumplings are made of rice, white prawns, tofu and usually
          pork. When you put one of those in your mouth, you could feel the layering
          texture: the fried crispy dumpling skin is well combined with umami fragrance of
          shrimp and pork. Not gonna lie, I ate probably 40 of those last time when I visited Sanhe.
          (I am getting hungry while I am searching the food pictures at this moment = =)

        <p>Do you like crayfish? Welcome to Hefei to try for those braised spicy crayfish!
          In Hefei, the braised spicy crayfish is an outstanding specialty dish, and
          some people from other cities travel a far distance to try our crayfish. If
          you like spicy food and crayfish, it is definitely the best for you! They are
          flavorful, appetizing, and SPICY!
